The "Retail_trades_pre201610" and "Retail_trades_post201610" files each contain a SAS macro, meant to run on WRDS, to calculate retail trade measures following Boehmer, Jones, Zhang, and Zhang (2020).

The "pre201610" file is for TAQ data 10/20/2016 and earlier, and the "post201610" file is for TAQ data 10/21/2016 and later.

The two files contain code to calculate several additional measures not used in the paper (e.g., trade size-based measures) as well. Please read the files carefully for further instructions and assumptions made.
